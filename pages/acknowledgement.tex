I am deeply grateful to Prof. Dr. Gefei Zhang for his guidance, helpful feedback, and constant encouragement throughout this thesis. My thanks also go to Stephan Lindauer for his technical advice, practical suggestions, and willingness to discuss ideas at every turn.

Finally, my appreciation goes to my family and friends for their patience and moral support during the long hours of writing and experimentation.

Any remaining errors are entirely my own.
